                <h4>Hi, I'm Alex, this is my blog. I want to do more programming and write about it here. 
                    I haven't made my choice of studying making dos games, games with unity or websites 
                    because I don't know what I'm most interested in, so I'll probably do nothing as usual. I also play the guitar and maybe will post something about it</h4>

                <h2>Computer science ðŸ–¥</h2>
                <h4>I'm interested in learning something about computers, old games, old websites, how everything works, etc</h4>
                <h2>Guitar ðŸŽ¸</h2>
                <h4>I like to learn to play music that I like, so that's what I'm doing for of the time. The song that I'm currently learning is Paranoid.
                    I've been working on it since October, but still not there yet. Guess I'll need to switch to something and then come back.

                <h4>I do python programming, like solving problems with it, want to find a way of using it. I also tried PascalABC.NET, QBasic, kumir and a bit of C++ at school</h4>
                <h2>Guitar</h2>
                <h4>I've played the guitar for about 2.5 years, got my first electric guitar in November. I hope to improve my skills this summer, but, again, I never know what to do</h4>
